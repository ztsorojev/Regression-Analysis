# Regression-Analysis

**Language:** Python 3.6 <br>
**Library:** scikit-learn

In this project, we will use K-means clustering to determine to which class some data points belong to. <br>
The dataset is the same as for project 1 : "20 Newsgroups", except that this time, we consider no a priori knowledge of the category labeling. The goal of this project is to find proper representations of the data and preprocessing methods to perform an efficient clustering.
